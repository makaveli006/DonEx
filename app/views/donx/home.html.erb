    <p>These messages indicate that certain signals are not being handled by the system or program that is generating them. SIGUSR2, SIGUSR1, and SIGHUP are all signals that can be used to control the behavior of a program. In this case, it seems that the program is not able to respond to these signals, so certain functionality (such as restarting or reopening logs) is unavailable.</p>
